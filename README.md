# My-MOBA-Game-
A simple MOBA game made by using Pygame

Hey there! It's a basic 2D Moba Game created using Pygame in Visual Studio Code. I set the settings as you can play the game forever, because your health point doesn't decrease when the enemies hit you. 

At the beginning, there will be a section which you can choose the colour you want, I'd recommend you blue, green or yellow because enemies are red so it would be better if the player colour is more visible.

Here's a quick guide how you can play the game.

1. Moving 
   For moving, left click on the mouse. When you click on the arena, your character (square) will go to where you click.
   
2. Attacking
   For attacking, there are 4 different ways to attack your enemy. Q, W, E, R.
   
   Explore them by pressing them on the keyboard ! It's a secret.

Thanks.
